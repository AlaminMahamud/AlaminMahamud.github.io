** Specialty
I am a full-stack engineer with over 5 years of experience.
I have maintained, developed and launched [[/portfolio][Multiple Projects]] from scratch,
carrying the development of its backend and front-end codebases.
My current toolset includes *NodeJS*, *Express*, *MongoDB*, *Angular/React* and numerouse frameworks, libraries and technologies related to them. [[/skills][Graphical Representation]].
Feel free to ask me any questions. I can help you in your project in all from the UI mockups, back-end and front-end web development to fixing the design and installing and configuration of the application on *staging/production* environments.

** Front-End Web Development.
*I specialize in applications based on =AngularJS= | =ReactJS=.*
My current experience and skills in front-end:
- Senior Javascript Development, a'la prototype programming, promises etc.
- full integration of front-end development using [[gulpjs.com][Gulp]].
- usage of tools like BrowserSync, automatic tests, code miniification, multiple environment support.
- usage of much more work-effective language syntaxes like: [[co][CoffeScript]] / [[http://][ES6]] / [[http://][ES7]] / [[http://][TypeScript]]
- good sense of design  and typography, together with some past experiences in designing in Photoshop.
- knowledge of many open source JS libraries like React, Redux, Flux, Backbone, jQuery, Lodash/Underscore.
- ...and even *Mobile WebApp Dev* with the use of =Apache Cordova= & =Ionic Framework=.
With these, I can build a fully working native application for iOS and Android (both at once!) in Javascript in less than month.
*You can already find some of my mobile applications in [[/portfolio][my portfolio]].

** Back-End Web Development
*I fully develop my back-ends in =Ruby on Rails= and alternatively NodeJS or Elixir.

What I do is:
- Senior development of Ruby on Rails web applications and/or RESTful API servers (often used later in the Front-End Angular Application).
- cooperation with APIs, remote data synSchnorizations, cloud servers, workers 
- using different type of databases (=MySQL=, =PostgreSQL=, =ElasticSearch=).
- dividing the servers onto different nodes, databases sharding, load balancing.
- deploying the application to the server with =Git= / =Capistrano=, =Chef= or =Ansible=
- refactoring badly-written applications.
- writing unit & e2e tests.

** What about Dev-Ops, Design, UI?
*During my time I have created tens of websites*
Thus, not only I have coded their back-end and front-end code, but I also often cared about other things needed in a successful web application.

- good UI Planning and thinking how it affects the UX.
- consistency in design, typography.
- search Engine Optimization.
- deployment to the server (f.e. using =Chef=) and monitor its processes to avoid downtimes.

You say that I can't be the best in everything? Okay Send the UI & design job to someone else and I'll take care of all the development ;)

*Of course I don't always work alone. I like working in a team. If you have an already working project/team, but still need someone to help it, contact me. I'll fit into your needs.
